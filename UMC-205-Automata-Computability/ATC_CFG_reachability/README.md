# ATC_CFG_Reachability

## ðŸ”¹Problem Description
**Given**
- Directed Weighted Graph (each edge is labeled is a charactor 'a' to 'z')
- Start Vertex
- End Vertex
- Context Free Grammer in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF)

**Target**

We have to determine  whether  there  is  a  path  from  a  given source node to a target node such that the sequence of edge labels along the path forms  a  string  derivable  from  the  CFG

## ðŸ”¹ Input Format

- Number of inputs (n)
- Next 4n lines contains each input
  - CFG in CNF form
  - Graph
  - start_vertex
  - end_vertex


## ðŸ”¹ Output Format
- **`Yes`** if there exist a path as described above
- **`No`** otherwise.

## ðŸ”¹Example
### **Input**
```
